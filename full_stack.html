                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <b>Introduction</b>
                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a fundamental language for creating web content. In HTML, elements are used to structure and format web pages, incorporating text, images, links, and multimedia. HTML5, the latest version, introduced modern features like improved semantics, multimedia support, and enhanced interactivity, making it crucial for web development.</p>
                <hr>
                <b>Text Formatting</b>
                <p>Text formatting in HTML involves applying various styles to text content. This includes changing text color, size, font, alignment, and more using tags like "font", "span", "div", and CSS properties. It enhances the visual presentation and readability of web content, making it a crucial aspect of web design.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <b>Audio,Video & Image Formating</b>
                <p>In HTML, audio and video formatting is achieved using the "audio" and "video" elements, allowing the inclusion of multimedia content with playback controls. Images are formatted using the "img" element and can be resized, aligned, or linked to other resources. CSS can be applied to style and position these elements for a better user experience.</p>
                <hr>
                <b>Tables Attributes</b>
                <p>Tables in HTML use attributes to control their structure and appearance. Common attributes include 'border' for border thickness, 'cellspacing' and 'cellpadding' to manage spacing, 'width' and 'height' for dimensions, 'align' for table alignment, 'bgcolor' for background color, and 'colspan'/'rowspan' to merge cells. These attributes help customize table presentation and layout.</p>
                <hr>
                <b>List in HTML</b>
                <p>In HTML, lists are used to organize and present information. There are three main types of lists: Ordered Lists (ol): Displays items in a numbered sequence.
                Unordered Lists (ul): Presents items with bullet points or other markers. 2.Definition Lists (dl): Consists of terms and their definitions using "dt" and "dd". 3.Lists help structure content for better readability and comprehension."/p"
                <hr>
                <b>Forms</b>
                <p>HTML forms allow users to input data on a web page. They are created using the "form" element and include various input fields like text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, and buttons. Data entered in forms can be submitted to a server for processing, making them essential for user interaction and data collection on websites.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="four">
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <b>Introduction</b>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a design language used in web development. It defines the visual presentation and layout of HTML elements, allowing designers to control fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning. CSS separates design from content, enhancing the appearance and consistency of web pages across different devices and browsers.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Selectors</b>
            <p>Selectors in CSS are patterns used to target and style specific HTML elements. They specify which elements to apply styles to. Common selectors include type selectors (e.g., h1), class selectors (e.g., .highlight), and ID selectors (e.g., #header). Selectors help customize the appearance of web content by defining which elements to affect.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Specificity</b>
            <p>Specificity in CSS determines which style rules apply when multiple conflicting rules target the same element. It's calculated based on selectors' specificity values. Inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by IDs, classes, and element selectors. Understanding specificity helps resolve style conflicts and ensure the correct styles are applied.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Inheritance and Cascading</b>
            <p>Inheritance in CSS refers to the way styles are passed down from parent elements to their children. Child elements inherit styles like color and font settings, which creates a hierarchical approach to styling.
            Cascading refers to the order of priority when multiple conflicting style rules apply. It follows a specific order, enabling a systematic way to determine which styles should be applied, considering factors like specificity and source order.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Box Model in CSS</b>
            <p>The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are structured as rectangular boxes. It includes content, padding, border, and margin. The dimensions and spacing of an element are determined by these components. Developers can control and modify these properties to design effective layouts and spacing in web pages.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Display flex</b>
            <p>display: flex is a CSS property that establishes a flex container, enabling a flexible layout for its child elements. It allows them to align horizontally or vertically, distribute space, and adapt to various screen sizes. Flexbox is widely used for creating responsive and efficient designs, simplifying complex layouts.

            <h2>JAVA</h2>
            <b>Introduction</b>
            <p>Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence, allowing code to run on different systems. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), Java offers a robust and secure environment for software development, encompassing a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it versatile for various applications.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>patterns</b>
            <p>In the context of Java, "patterns" typically refers to design patterns. These are recurring solutions to common problems in software design. Examples include Singleton for ensuring a class has only one instance, and Factory for creating objects without specifying the exact class. Design patterns promote efficient, reusable, and maintainable code.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Data Types</b>
            <p>In Java, data types define the kind of values a variable can hold. They are categorized into two groups: primitive data types (int, double, char, etc.) for basic values, and reference data types (objects and arrays) that refer to complex data structures. Data types ensure type safety and efficient memory usage in Java programs.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Variables</b>
            <p>In Java, variables are named containers used to store data. They have a data type (e.g., int, String) and can hold values of that type. Variables are declared using keywords like "int" or "String" and can be manipulated, reassigned, or used in expressions to perform various operations within Java programs.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Methods</b>
            <p>In Java, methods are blocks of code within classes that perform specific tasks. They encapsulate functionality, promoting code reusability and organization. Methods have names, parameters, and may return values. They play a fundamental role in structuring Java programs and facilitating modular, maintainable, and efficient code.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Arrays</b>
            <p>Arrays in Java are data structures that store multiple values of the same data type. They are defined with a fixed size and provide indexed access to elements. Arrays are commonly used for managing collections of items and simplifying repetitive data processing tasks in Java programs.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Strings</b>
            <p>In Java, strings are sequences of characters. They are objects of the String class and can be manipulated using various methods. Java strings are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed after creation. They are widely used for text processing and manipulation in Java applications.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>OOPS</b>
            <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects." It encompasses principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Java classes define objects, which have attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods). OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and a structured approach to software development in Java.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Interface</b>
            <p>In Java, interfaces are a way to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance. They define a contract of methods that classes implementing the interface must provide. Interfaces provide a mechanism for standardizing the behavior of classes and are crucial for achieving polymorphism in Java, making code more flexible and maintainable.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Multi Threading</b>
            <p>Multithreading in Java is a technique where multiple threads run concurrently within a single program. It allows for parallel execution of tasks, enhancing performance and responsiveness. Java's multithreading capabilities are provided by the java.lang.Thread class and the java.util.concurrent package, facilitating efficient and synchronized execution of tasks.</p>

            <h1><i>Data Base</i></h1>
            <div id="six">
                <h2>SQL</h2>
                <b>Introduction</b>
            <p>Databases are structured collections of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and management. They underpin many software applications, storing information in tables with relationships. SQL is a common language for querying and managing databases, while various database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle facilitate data organization and retrieval.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Attributes</b>
            <p>Attributes in databases are the characteristics or properties that define data within a table. Each attribute corresponds to a column in a table, specifying the type of data it can hold, such as text, numbers, or dates. Attributes provide the structure for organizing and storing data in a database.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>ER Diagrams</b>
            <p>ER (Entity-Relationship) diagrams are visual representations of a database's structure. They illustrate the entities (objects or concepts) in a database and the relationships between them. ER diagrams use symbols like rectangles for entities, diamonds for relationships, and lines to show connections. They help in database design and understanding data relationships.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Data Types</b>
            <p>Data types in databases specify the kind of data that can be stored in a column or attribute. Common data types include integers, strings, dates, and floating-point numbers. Defining data types ensures data integrity, optimal storage, and efficient querying by restricting the type of data that can be stored in each field.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>operators</b>
            <p>Operators in databases are symbols or keywords used in SQL to perform operations on data. They include comparison operators (e.g., =, >, <), logical operators (e.g., AND, OR), and arithmetic operators (e.g., +, -). Operators are essential for filtering, sorting, and manipulating data in database queries.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Functions</b>
            <p>Functions in databases are built-in or user-defined operations that manipulate data during queries or data retrieval. SQL offers functions like SUM, AVG, and COUNT to perform calculations on data. User-defined functions can be created to perform specific tasks. Functions are used to transform, aggregate, and extract meaningful information from database data.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Sub Queries</b>
            <p>Subqueries in databases are nested SQL queries within larger queries. They allow the retrieval of data based on the results of another query. Subqueries can be used in SELECT, WHERE, or FROM clauses and are valuable for complex filtering, data extraction, and joining operations, enhancing the versatility of database queries.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Joins</b>
            <p>Joins in databases are SQL operations that combine data from multiple tables based on related columns. They create a single result set that includes data from all the tables, allowing the retrieval of information from multiple sources. Common join types include INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL, each serving different data combination purposes. Joins facilitate complex data retrieval and analysis.</p>
